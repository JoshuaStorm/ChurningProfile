# ChurningProfile
A web application for individuals who want to simplify the process of optimizing their credit card bonuses.

# Running Project
In order to run this project you will need NPM and Meteor.

I believe the Meteor install includes NPM if you do not already have it.
https://www.meteor.com/install

You can then just pull this repo, `cd` into the directory, run `meteor npm install`, and then run `meteor` to start the server locally on port `3000`. Meteor even boots up a Mongo instance.

Please report any issues getting this up in running in the issues tab.
